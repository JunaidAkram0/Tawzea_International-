# Tawzea International Group – Project Overview

## The goal of this project is to develop and implement a data-driven Key Performance Indicator (KPI) framework for Tawzea International Group, a leading water utility and distribution company. This initiative aims to enhance operational efficiency, optimize resource utilization, and improve service reliability through continuous performance monitoring across both wastewater and RO (Reverse Osmosis) water plants.

Founded in 2004, Tawzea International Group is a leading Saudi water and wastewater service provider, operating across all 13 regions of the Kingdom. The company delivers eco-friendly and efficient water distribution, wastewater treatment, and environmental services while adhering to global quality standards. Now they have implemented a comprehensive KPI dashboard, Tawzea aims to strengthen data-driven decision-making to achieve two primary objectives:

1. To enhance operational efficiency and resource utilization across its plants
2. To improve customer satisfaction and service reliability nationwide

#### Strategic Objectives

* Improving plant performance monitoring
* Reducing water losses and enhancing water utilization
* Increasing energy and chemical usage efficiency
* Optimizing preventive maintenance strategies
* Ensuring compliance with quality standards
* Enhancing response time to complaints and customer satisfaction levels

---

#### Dataset Structure

The dataset integrates operational and customer service metrics, combining data from wastewater and RO plants with customer feedback and incident tracking. The metrics include:

* **Plant Performance**: Utilization rate, water utilization/loss %, quality compliance, preventive maintenance rate
* **Resource Efficiency**: Energy efficiency (kWh/m³), chemical usage (kg/m³)
* **Incident Tracking**: Breaks or overflows per km, incident rate per hour
* **Customer Service**: Satisfaction %, total complaints, complaint type distribution, resolution rate, and average response time



---

#### Insights Summary

**Plant Utilization Rate**

* Wastewater Plant: 96.98% utilization rate – slightly higher than RO Water Plant’s 95.93%, indicating consistent operational capacity usage

**Water Utilization / Loss %**

* Wastewater Plant water utilization is low at 36.42%, suggesting significant opportunity for improved recycling and reuse
* RO Water Plant shows 5.50% water loss, a strong performance compared to industry benchmarks

**Quality Compliance**

* Wastewater Plant compliance: 91.61%, outperforming RO Water Plant’s 86.49%
* RO plant’s lower compliance suggests targeted improvement is needed in treatment processes or monitoring

**Preventive Maintenance**

* RO Plant leads with 83.72% preventive maintenance rate, slightly higher than Wastewater’s 80.77%, indicating more proactive asset care

**Energy & Chemical Usage**

* RO Plant is more energy efficient (1.23 kWh/m³) compared to Wastewater (1.48 kWh/m³)
* RO Plant chemical usage is much lower (0.03 kg/m³) versus Wastewater (0.41 kg/m³), highlighting a cost and sustainability advantage

**Incidents & Breaks**

* Both plants have low breaks/overflows per km (0.02), but Wastewater has a higher incident rate (0.05/h) than RO Plant (0.0046/h)

**Customer Satisfaction & Complaints**

* Satisfaction is at 68%, leaving 32% of customers unsatisfied
* Average complaint response time is 4.05 hours
* Top complaint types: Low Water Pressure (35.56%), Billing Issues (33.33%), Water Quality Issues (31.11%)
* Resolution rate is high at 73.33%, but 26.67% complaints remain pending

---

#### Recommendations

* **Water Utilization**: Focus on improving Wastewater Plant’s utilization rate through increased recycling and reuse initiatives to raise from 36.42% toward industry benchmarks
* **Quality Compliance**: Investigate root causes of RO Plant’s lower compliance (86.49%) and implement stricter quality control procedures
* **Energy & Chemical Optimization**: Leverage RO Plant’s chemical efficiency practices to reduce Wastewater Plant’s chemical usage
* **Incident Reduction**: Address operational risks leading to Wastewater Plant’s higher incident rate (0.05/h)
* **Customer Service**: Reduce average response time to under 3 hours to boost customer satisfaction above 75%
* **Complaint Type Focus**: Prioritize improvements in water pressure and billing system accuracy, which account for over two-thirds of complaints
